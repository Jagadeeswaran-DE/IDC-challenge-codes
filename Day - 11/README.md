# Day 11 – Statistics, Hypothesis Testing & Feature Engineering 📊🧠

Day 11 focuses on **understanding data behavior** and using statistics to support decisions.
This marks a shift from *building data pipelines* to *analyzing and interpreting data*.

---

## 🎯 Objective

Learn how to:

* Summarize data using descriptive statistics
* Test assumptions using hypothesis testing
* Understand A/B testing concepts
* Engineer features for machine learning

These skills are essential for **analytics, experimentation, and ML readiness**.

---

## 🧠 Concepts Covered

### 1. Descriptive Statistics

Descriptive statistics help understand the overall shape and behavior of data.

Covered concepts:

* Mean and median
* Distribution of values
* Identifying outliers

This answers questions like:

> What is normal?
> Are there extreme values?

---

### 2. Hypothesis Testing (Weekday vs Weekend)

A simple business question was tested:

> Do users behave differently on weekdays compared to weekends?

Steps followed:

1. Categorized data into weekday and weekend
2. Counted user actions (views, carts, purchases)
3. Compared results instead of relying on assumptions

This demonstrated how **data can validate or reject beliefs**.

---

### 3. A/B Testing Concepts

Learned the fundamentals of experimentation:

* Control group (A)
* Test group (B)
* Measuring impact using metrics

A/B testing helps organizations make **safe, data-driven changes**.

---

### 4. Correlation Analysis

Explored relationships between variables to identify patterns such as:

* Price vs purchases
* Views vs conversions

Important learning:

> Correlation does not always imply causation

---

### 5. Feature Engineering

Raw data was transformed into meaningful features for machine learning:

* Weekend / weekday flags
* Derived metrics
* Time-based features

Good features improve model performance and interpretability.

---

## 🛠️ Tasks Completed

* Calculated statistical summaries
* Performed hypothesis testing
* Compared weekday vs weekend behavior
* Identified correlations between variables
* Engineered new features for ML pipelines

---

## 🎯 Key Takeaway

> Data tells stories.
> **Statistics help us understand and trust those stories.**

This day strengthened the ability to make **evidence-based decisions**.

---

## 🧑‍💼 Business Perspective

Statistical analysis enables:

* Better decision-making
* Reduced bias and assumptions
* Improved experimentation and optimization

These skills bridge analytics and machine learning.
